# Stock-Price-Predicting-Using-LSTM

LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective. The reason they work so well is because LSTM is able to store past information that is important, and forget the information that is not.
To build the stock price prediction model, we will use the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages Limited, National Stock Exchange of India.Since, the dataset used in sequential data we are using LSTM because it works great with the time series data.
